*Be sure to take measurements in the "Default" configuration of the profiler to ensure your logging logic is not impacting current/time measurements.*

*Please include screenshots of the profiler window detailing each current measurement captured.  See [Shared document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ro9G2Nsr_ZXDhBYJ6YyF9CPivb--6UjhHRmVhDGySag/edit?usp=sharing) for instructions.* 

1. What is the average current per period?
   Answer:
   88uA   
  
2. What is the average current when the Si7021 is Load Power Management OFF?
   Answer:
   13uA   
   

3. What is the average current when the Si7021 is Load Power Management ON?
   Answer:
   2mA  
  
4. How long is the Si7021 Load Power Management ON for 1 temperature reading?
   Answer:
   132ms  
  

5. What is the total operating time of your design for assignment 4 in hours assuming a 1000mAh supply?
   Consumption over 1 period: 88uA. 
   Consumption over 1 hour: 105mA
 Time taken for source to get drained: 9hours.

6. How has the power consumption performance of your design changed since the previous assignment?  
Total Consumption on the current system is 2x less than the previous one. Implying that the source will last for 2x more time than the previous system. The battery consumption of previous source would be at most 4.5hours. 
     
7. Describe how you have tested your code to ensure you are sleeping in EM1 mode during I2C transfers.
 While transitioning between events of Write and Read, SLEEP_SleepBlockBegin(EM2) has been initiated. This prevents the system from lapsing into EM3/EM2 during the transitions. Once the Read is successful, the SLEEP_SleepBlockEnd(EM2) is invoked.
